title: Hello!
---
I am a PhD student at University of California at Davis, where I am advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yjlee/">Dr. Yong Jae Lee</a>. I work on automating the detection of pain in horses by using deep convolutional networks as part of a large interdisciplinary team. This summer I interned with the Vision/ML team at Yahoo in San Francisco.
        
Before starting my PhD, I worked at the exciting startup Mint Solutions where I did machine learning and computer vision research for MedEye - a patient bedside pill scanning device that prevents drug errors. I am a 2014 Masters graduate from Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute where I was advised by Dr. Martial Hebert. I was funded by Fulbright Scholarship. I worked on the problem of indoor scene understanding with the aid of 3D models. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in 2011 under advisement of Dr. Sohaib Khan. I worked on the problem of single view 2D to 3D reconstruction.

In my free time I love to read books, collect stories, try different kinds of food, and travel.
