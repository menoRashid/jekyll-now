title: Hello!
---
I am a PhD student at University of California at Davis, where I am advised by [Dr. Yong Jae Lee](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yjlee/). I work on automating the detection of pain in horses by using deep networks. 

I have had the wonderful opportunity of being a visiting research student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm with [Hedvig Kjellstr√∂m](http://www.csc.kth.se/~hedvig/) and [Pia Haubro Anderson](https://www.slu.se/cv/pia-haubro/) at Swedish Agricultural University for Fall 2018. In Summer 2017 I interned with the lovely Vision/ML team at Yahoo in San Francisco.
        
Before starting my PhD, I worked at the exciting startup [Mint Solutions](https://medeye.io/) where I did machine learning and computer vision research for MedEye - a patient bedside pill scanning device that prevents drug errors. I am a 2014 Masters graduate from [Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) where I was advised by [Dr. Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/). I was funded by Fulbright Scholarship. I worked on the problem of indoor scene understanding with the aid of 3D models. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the [Lahore University of Management Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk/) in 2011 under advisement of [Dr. Sohaib Khan](http://web.lums.edu.pk/~sohaib/). I worked on the problem of single view 2D to 3D reconstruction.

In my free time I love to read books, collect stories, try different kinds of food, and travel.
