title: Hello!
---
I am a computer vision scientist at [Univrses](https://univrses.com) in Stockholm, Sweden. I develop computer vision and deep learning technology for smart cities as part of the [3DAI City](https://univrses.com/3dai-city) team.

I completed my PhD in March 2021 from University of California Davis, where I was advised by [Dr. Yong Jae Lee](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yjlee/). I worked on automating the detection of pain in horses with deep networks, and small, weakly annotated datasets. During my PhD I interned at Amazon Berlin, and Oath Inc (previously Yahoo). I also had the wonderful opportunity of being a visiting research student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm with [Hedvig Kjellstr√∂m](http://www.csc.kth.se/~hedvig/) and at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala with [Pia Haubro Anderson](https://www.slu.se/cv/pia-haubro/).
        
Before starting my PhD, I did machine learning and computer vision research at [MedEye](https://medeye.io/). I am a 2014 Masters graduate from Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute where I was advised by [Dr. Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/). I was funded by Fulbright Scholarship. I worked on the problem of indoor scene understanding with the aid of 3D models. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in 2011 under advisement of [Dr. Sohaib Khan](http://web.lums.edu.pk/~sohaib/). I worked on the problem of single view 2D to 3D reconstruction.

In my free time I love to cook, read, and travel.
